# Microservices with Go and Micro

This is a ten part series, released weekly on writing microservices in Golang. Making use of protobuf and gRPC as the underlying transport protocol. Why? Because it took me a long time to figure this out and settle on a solution that was clear and concise, and I wanted to share what I'd learnt about creating, testing and deploying microservices end-to-end with others new to the scene.
